# DoRa Block Battle

## 📌 Introduction
**DoRa Block Battle** is a strategic **AI-powered** game where players compete against an AI opponent by placing blocks on an **n × n grid**. The goal is to outmaneuver the opponent by strategically positioning blocks to limit their available moves, enhancing problem-solving and cognitive skills.

## 🎯 Objective
- Create an **immersive and intellectually stimulating** experience.
- Encourage **strategic thinking, decision-making, and spatial reasoning**.
- Provide an **educational and entertaining** gaming experience.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Overview
### **1️⃣ Player vs. AI Dynamic**
- Players take turns with the AI to **place blocks** on the grid.
- The aim is to position blocks **strategically** to prevent the opponent from making successful moves.

### **2️⃣ Playground Setup**
- The playground is an **n × n grid** where players and AI place blocks.
- Blocks are represented as **1s (occupied spaces) and 0s (empty spaces)**.

### **3️⃣ Block Types**

- Players and AI must **select and place** blocks wisely to optimize their moves.

### **4️⃣ Win Condition**
- The game continues until one player (or AI) **cannot legally place a block**.
- The remaining player (or AI) is declared the **winner**.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (for game logic and AI)
- **NumPy/Pandas** (for grid management)
- **Tkinter/PyGame** *(optional)* (for GUI representation)
